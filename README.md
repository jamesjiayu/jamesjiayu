I fell in love with programming and I have at least learned something, I think… 🤷‍♂️

I am fluent in classics like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Java, and Python.

My field of Interest is building new Web Technologies and Products in areas related to Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.

Whenever possible, I also apply my passion for developing products with Node.js and Modern Javascript Library and Frameworks like React.js and Next.js
